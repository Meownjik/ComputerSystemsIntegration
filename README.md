# ComputerSystemsIntegration
Just a University task. Lots of not really necessary services integrated in one. Reads news via Selenium, puts them to queue, inserts into DB, reads and caches, and finally displays to user.

- Update news database: mvn test -Dtest=EcoNewsIntegrationTest

- To run desktop app, run App#main

- Run server for web client: mvn test -Dtest=ServerTest
